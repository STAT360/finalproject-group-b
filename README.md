Final proposal:

We plan on doing a Shiny App that has filters that overlay on a map to represent different features that show the desirability of a state in the US.  We do not know where we will start to look for data but we assume that state websites will have data on the state so we should be able to find an outside source that has compiled that data.  The purpose of the project will be to create a tool that will be used by people when they are looking to travel to a state or to move to a state and will hopefully make their decision process easier.

For our project we created a Shiny App that focuses on the livability of a state in the U.S based on a specific data list of criteria. This data includes unemployment rates, graduation rates, crime rates, median household income, and health insurance coverage of the specific state. We have included a map of all the states and a corresponding table of each criteria which highlights the best and worst states. The user is allowed to select one criteria at a time and view the rankings of each state based on that basis. This app would help users make decision on what state to live in based on these data.

The prerun file contains all the packages that need to be installed and loaded for the app. In order to run our project, the prerun file must be ran first.
