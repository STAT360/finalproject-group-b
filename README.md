# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

We plan on doing a Shiny App that has filters that overlay on a map to represent different features that show the desirability of a state in the US.  We do not know where we will start to look for data but we assume that state websites will have data on the state so we should be able to find an outside source that has compiled that data.  The purpose of the project will be to create a tool that will be used by people when they are looking to travel to a state or to move to a state and will hopefully make their decision process easier.
